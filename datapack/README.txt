Configurable values can be found in data/oceanus/density_functions/configurable

You can tweak:

- Unaffected radius: radius in which terrain generation is unchanged
- Falloff radius: width of the band in which land is gradually taken over by sea
- Mushroom island generation: enable or disable
- Ocean variability: how much variation there will be to ocean terrain
- Offset X: offsets the center of the unaffected radius on the x-axis
- Offset Z: offsets the center of the unaffected radius on the z-axis
