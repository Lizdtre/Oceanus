## Checks
- [ ] Have i downloaded the mod as a datapack and tested different loading orders in relation to Oceanus?
- [ ] Have checked the [Add-ons/fixes](https://github.com/Lizdtre/Oceanus/wiki/Add%E2%80%90ons) page for one that might already have solved this issue?
- [ ] Have i checked for existing [Issues](https://github.com/Lizdtre/Oceanus/issues) requesting support for this mod?

What does the world look like when i try to generate it with both the mod/pack and Oceanus enabled?

{Delete all but one of the following}
> Neither Oceanus nor the mod/pack work

> Only Oceanus works

> Only the mod/pack works

> Both Oceanus and the mod/pack works, but something is wrong (Elaborate below)

## Mod/pack

Add compatibility for {MOD_NAME} version {VERSION_NUMBER}
